<p>The spectrum produced by white light is</p>
<p>Emission spectrum</p>
<p>Continuous spectrum</p>
<p>Absorption spectrum</p>
<p>Both emission and continuous spectrum</p>
2
<p>A continuous spectrum contains many different colors, or wavelengths, with no gaps. Perfectly white light shined through a prism causes dispersion of the light, and we see a rainbow.<br>
when a gas is heated, the atoms in the gas absorb the energy and emit light, and an emission spectrum results.</p>

<p>Identify the correct statement with reference to human digestive system. [NEET 2020 ]</p>
<p>IIeum is a highly coiled part</p>
<p>Vermiform appendix arises from duodenum</p>
<p>IIeum opens into small intestine</p>
<p>Serosa is the innermost layer of the alimentary canal</p>

<p>The appendix originates from the posteromedial aspect of the cecum.<br> The ileum is the last of the three parts of the small intestine. The transition from the jejunum to the ileum is not sharply marked, while at the distal end, the ileum opens into the cecum.<br> The mucosa is the innermost layer of the gastrointestinal tract <br>Answer:(a)</p>


<p>The enzyme enterokinase helps in conversion of .. [NEET 2020]</p>
<p>caseinogen into casein</p>
<p>pepsinogen into pepsin</p>
<p>protein into polypeptides</p>
<p>trypsinogen into trypsin</p>

<p>human teeth have all of these characteristic that’s why their dentition refers to as thecodont, heterodont and diphyodont.<br> Thecodont having the teeth inserted in sockets.<br> heterodont: having the teeth differentiated into incisors, canines, and molars.<br> Diphyodont is a type of dentition in which two successive sets of teeth are developed during the lifetime of the organism. The first set of teeth is deciduous and the other set is permanent. <br>   Answer : (b)</p>
